# Duckietown-Documentation

* use ./duckietown_installation to install all required dts libraries
* chnages after source ~/.bashrc only refelct while opening a new termonal, so close the installation terminal and open a new one to see dts commands working.
* Also do 'chmod +x duckietown_installation' before running the script (./duckietown_installation)
