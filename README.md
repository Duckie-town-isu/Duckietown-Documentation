# Duckietown-Documentation

* use ./duckietown_installation to install all required dts libraries
* chnages after source ~/.bashrc only refelct while opening a new termonal, so close the installation terminal and open a new terminal
* now run the post_installation script to set chnages and final installation of duckietown.
* now use dts commands to see how dts works.
** NOTE: Do 'chmod +x duckietown_installation' before running the script (./duckietown_installation)
